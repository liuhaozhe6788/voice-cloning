## Code Modification Records
**2022.05.19：** I calculated GE2E loss in encoder with cuda rather than originally-configured CPU. It speeds up the encoder training speed.<br>
**2022.07.15：** I added Loss animation plot for synthesizer and vocoder.<br>
**2022.07.19：** I added response time and Griffin-Lim vocoder results for demo_toolbox.
